What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n","  - Interpreted languages execute code line-by-line at runtime, while compiled languages translate the entire code into machine language before execution.\n","\n","2. What is exception handling in Python?\n","  - Exception handling is the process of detecting and responding to runtime errors to prevent program crashes.\n","\n","3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n","  - The finally block is used to execute code that must run regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.\n","\n","4. What is logging in Python?\n","  - Logging is the process of recording messages about a programâ€™s execution for debugging and monitoring.\n","\n","5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n","  - The __del__ method is a destructor that is called when an object is about to be destroyed to perform cleanup actions.\n","\n","6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n","  - import brings in the entire module, while from ... import imports specific attributes or functions from a module.\n","\n","7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n","  - Multiple exceptions can be handled by listing them in a single except clause or using multiple except clauses.\n","\n","8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n","  - The with statement ensures that a file is properly closed after its block of code is executed, even if errors occur.\n","\n","9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n","  - Multithreading runs multiple threads within the same process, while multiprocessing runs multiple processes with separate memory spaces.\n","\n","10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n","   - Logging helps in tracking issues, debugging, monitoring execution flow, and keeping a history of events.\n","\n","11. What is memory management in Python?\n","   - Memory management is the process of allocating, using, and freeing memory efficiently during program execution.\n","\n","12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n","   - The steps are: detect the error, raise an exception, catch the exception, and handle it appropriately.\n","\n","13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n","   - It ensures efficient use of system resources, prevents memory leaks, and maintains performance.\n","\n","14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n","   - try contains code that may cause an exception, and except defines how to handle that exception.\n","\n","15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n","   - It automatically frees unused memory by reclaiming objects that have no references.\n","\n","16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n","   - The else block runs if no exception occurs in the try block.\n","\n","17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n","   - Common levels are DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL.\n","\n","18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n","   - os.fork() creates a child process by duplicating the current process (Unix only), while multiprocessing works cross-platform and creates independent processes.\n","\n","19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n","  - Closing a file ensures that system resources are released and all data is properly written.\n","\n","20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n","   - file.read() reads the entire file or a specified number of bytes, while file.readline() reads a single line.\n","\n","21. What is the logging module in Python used for?\n","   - It is used for creating and managing log messages in a program.\n","\n","22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n","   - It provides functions for interacting with the operating system, such as file and directory operations.\n","\n","23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n","  - Challenges include memory leaks, circular references, and managing large data structures efficiently.\n","\n","24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n","  - An exception can be raised manually using the raise statement.\n","\n","25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n","   -  Multithreading is useful for tasks that require concurrent execution, such as I/O-bound operations, to improve efficiency."],"metadata":{"id":"0LMNsCrFVsaM"}}]}
